When it comes to extreme automotive performance, two terms often dominate the conversation: **supercars** and **hypercars**.

But what exactly is the difference?

## What Is a Supercar?

A **supercar** is a high-performance, street-legal vehicle that delivers jaw-dropping speed, cutting-edge design, and premium features. Think of the **Ferrari 488**, **Lamborghini Huracán**, or **McLaren 720S**. These cars often balance track-level performance with some everyday usability.

## What Is a Hypercar?

**Hypercars**, on the other hand, take things to the next level. These vehicles are the pinnacle of automotive engineering — ultra-rare, wildly expensive, and technologically advanced. They push the boundaries of speed, materials, and innovation. Examples include the **Bugatti Chiron**, **Koenigsegg Jesko**, and **Aston Martin Valkyrie**.

## Key Differences

- **Performance**: Hypercars typically have better power-to-weight ratios and cutting-edge hybrid or electric systems.
- **Price & Rarity**: Hypercars cost significantly more and are produced in much smaller numbers.
- **Innovation**: Hypercars lead in futuristic tech and design concepts.

## Conclusion

While all hypercars are supercars, not all supercars qualify as hypercars. Both categories, however, represent dreams on wheels for car lovers around the world.
